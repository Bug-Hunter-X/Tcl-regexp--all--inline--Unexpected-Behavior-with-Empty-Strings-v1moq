This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl's `regexp -all -inline` command when dealing with empty strings or consecutive whitespace. The bug.tcl file shows the erroneous behavior, while bugSolution.tcl provides a robust solution.  The issue stems from how `regexp -all -inline` handles empty matches within the input string.  The solution involves pre-processing the input string to ensure it does not contain consecutive spaces or empty strings before applying the regular expression.
